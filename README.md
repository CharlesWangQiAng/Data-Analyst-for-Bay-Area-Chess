# Data-Analyst-for-Bay-Area-Chess
# Overview
In the early months of 2024, our team of Master of Quantitative Management (MQM) students at Duke University embarked on a Capstone project in collaboration with Bay Area Chess, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting chess education and enrichment programs for children and adults in the San Francisco Bay Area. The primary objective was to increase awareness and the number of sign-ups for their events. The project required a multifaceted approach, combining data analysis, digital marketing, and predictive modeling to achieve these goals.

# Pipeline
The project pipeline was designed to address both the operational and promotional challenges faced by Bay Area Chess. The key steps in our pipeline included:

Data Collection and Cleaning: We collected over 10,000 entries of historical event data from Bay Area Chess. This data included participant details, event dates, and other relevant metrics. The data was then cleaned to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Tableau, we performed an EDA to identify trends and patterns within the data. This analysis provided a solid foundation for subsequent feature engineering and model development.

Feature Engineering: Leveraging R and Python, we extracted key metrics and insights from the data. This step involved creating new variables that could enhance the predictive power of our models.

Predictive Modeling: We developed neural network and time series models to forecast future event attendance. These models were fine-tuned to achieve a prediction mean absolute error (MAE) of 7, significantly improving scheduling accuracy.

Digital Marketing Campaign: A targeted digital marketing campaign was designed and executed across email, Instagram, and Facebook platforms. Using the AWeber marketing tool, we tailored our campaigns to different customer segments, resulting in a 5% increase in sign-up rates.

A/B Testing: We implemented A/B testing to optimize our digital marketing strategies. By analyzing user interaction data with SQL and Excel, we refined our ad placements, which enhanced advertising effectiveness by 15%.

# Data Science Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was conducted using Tableau to provide a visual representation of data trends and patterns. This step was crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the data and identifying areas for further analysis.

Feature Engineering: We used R and Python for feature engineering. This involved creating new variables that captured important aspects of the data, such as temporal patterns and event-specific factors. These features were essential for improving the performance of our predictive models.

Neural Network and Time Series Modeling: We developed and fine-tuned neural network and time series models using Python. The neural network model helped capture complex, non-linear relationships within the data, while the time series model was used to predict future attendance based on historical trends.

A/B Testing: A/B testing was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different digital marketing strategies. By comparing various campaign elements, we identified the most effective approaches for engaging our target audience and increasing event sign-ups.

# Tools Used
Tableau: Used for conducting EDA and creating visualizations that helped us understand data trends and patterns. Tableau's interactive dashboards allowed us to communicate our findings effectively to stakeholders.

R and Python: These programming languages were used extensively for data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. R was particularly useful for statistical analysis and data manipulation, while Python was used for building and fine-tuning machine learning models.

AWeber: This email marketing tool was utilized for designing and executing targeted digital marketing campaigns. AWeber enabled us to segment our audience and deliver personalized content, resulting in higher engagement rates.

SQL and Excel: SQL was used for querying and managing the data stored in databases. Excel was employed for data analysis and A/B testing, providing a straightforward way to compare different marketing strategies and measure their effectiveness.

# Conclusion
Our Capstone project with Bay Area Chess was a comprehensive and rewarding experience that demonstrated the power of data science and digital marketing in solving real-world problems. By combining EDA, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and targeted marketing strategies, we were able to significantly enhance event attendance and improve the effectiveness of promotional efforts. This project not only benefited Bay Area Chess by increasing their reach and engagement but also provided valuable learning opportunities for our team, equipping us with practical skills and insights that will be invaluable in our future careers.

We are grateful for the support and guidance from our faculty advisors and the team at Bay Area Chess, particularly Professor Salman Azhar and Veena Raman. Their expertise and feedback were instrumental in the success of this project. As we move forward, we are excited to apply the knowledge and skills gained from this experience to new challenges and opportunities in the field of data science and beyond.
